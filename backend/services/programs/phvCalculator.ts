/**
 * PHV Calculator — Mirwald et al. (2002) Maturity Offset Equation
 *
 * Calculates Peak Height Velocity (PHV) stage from anthropometric measurements.
 * Used to modify training prescriptions for youth athletes undergoing growth spurts.
 *
 * Stages:
 *   pre_phv   (offset < -1.0)  → Focus on movement quality, coordination, fun
 *   mid_phv   (-1.0 to +1.0)   → Rapid growth — reduce load, avoid maximal efforts
 *   post_phv  (> +1.0)         → Gradual reintroduction of loading
 *   not_applicable (18+)        → Standard adult loading
